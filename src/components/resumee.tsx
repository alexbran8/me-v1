                           While experimenting different jobs and activities in the past years, programming has always been of a singinificant importance.
                           Previous experiences have made me more disciplined in what learning and constant development means. Since discovering React and modern technologies
                           I have focused mostly on developing myself into being able to better understand concepts, on  the ability to share my knowledge with others and create communities with programming enthusiasts.
                           Last years since being part of Nokia, I have been involved in managing and coordinating projects involving University teens eager to learn modern web development.

                           <p>Constant development with focused on advanced concepts regarding JavaScript and React is what I am striving for.</p>
